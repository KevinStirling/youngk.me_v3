title: Software Engineer, XR Obsessor, Drinker of Seltzer
---

I'm a builder of cyberspace technology, currently building tools and web applications for **[Throtle](https://throtle.io/)**. In my free time when I'm not drinking seltzer or watching baseball, I like learning about game engines, working with XR and VR technology, and making dumb games with my newfound knowledge. I aim to share my thoughts, experiences, and silly experiments here on **[this blog](/posts)**!
