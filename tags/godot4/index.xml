And although there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of really exciting 3d features coming to Godot 4, the 2d space is a bit more in my wheelhouse for now, as I continue to learn the engine.
One new feature I am looking forward to using in Godot 4 2d is the new TileMap node updates. To get myself farmiliar with the new TileMap api, I wanted a project that would let me dip my toes into this node, but I also wanted a project that had a small scope and ideally I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to think up rules or functionality from scratch.</description></item></channel></rss>
